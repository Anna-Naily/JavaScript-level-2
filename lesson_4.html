      'The island is the result of repeated sequences of shield volcano
      construction followed by caldera collapse'. The inner coast around the
      caldera is a sheer precipice of more than 300 metres (980 ft) drop at it's
      highest, and exhibits the various layers of solidified lava on top of each
      other, and the main towns perched on the crest. 'The ground then slopes
      outwards and downwards towards the outer perimeter, and the outer beaches
      are smooth and shallow'. Beach sand colour depends on which geological
      layer is exposed; there are beaches with sand or pebbles made of
      solidified lava of various colours: such as the Red Beach, the Black Beach
      and the White Beach. The water at the darker coloured beaches is<br />
      significantly warmer because the lava acts as a heat absorber. 'The area
      of Santorini incorporates a group of islands created by volcanoes,
      spanning across Thera, Thirasia, Aspronisi, Palea, and Nea Kameni'. Fira
      from Nea Kameni volcanic Island Santorini has erupted many times, with
      varying degrees of explosivity. There have been at least twelve large
      explosive eruptions, of which at least four were caldera-forming. The most
      famous eruption is the Minoan eruption, detailed below. 'Eruptive products
      range from basalt all the way to rhyolite, and the rhyolitic products are
      associated with the most explosive eruptions'.<br />
      It's a wonderfull place.<br />Don't forget it!
